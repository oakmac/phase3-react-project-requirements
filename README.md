## Project Description

Write an interesting web application using [React.js] and [Redux]. By this point
in the class you should have a solid grasp of git, GitHub, web fundamentals, and
general development workflow.

The structure for this project is intentionally flexible in order to let you
explore ideas, challenge yourself, and build something you want to create.

The focus of your project should be in the web browser (ie: frontend), and
specifically something that requires managing state using React.js and Redux. A
small game is an excellent project idea.
